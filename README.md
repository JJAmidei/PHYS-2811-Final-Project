# Modern Physics Final Project
------------------------------

This is a four-page tutorial for special relativity. Specifically, this project touches on the concepts of time dilation, length contraction, and relativistic momentum and energy, concluding with a discussion on the relativistic effects on atmospheric muons. 

This was created using the Anaconda 2023.03-0 distribution; in particular, with the Jupyter Notebook (v.6.5.2) application and the Numpy (v.1.23.5) and Matplotlib (v.3.7.0) libraries. 

## Viewing Notebook

In order to actually run the coded cells in this notebook, you will have to clone this repository and open each page in the Jupyter Notebook apllication. 

If you'd just like to preview a page, I've included .html links for this purpose. However, this will not allow you to run any of the coded cells.  

## Running Cells

Each cell should be self-contained, so it is not necessary to run them in any specific order. However, if a cell is not running for whatever reason, try to restart the kernel. If the problem persists, create an issue (including information about the page number, section, and/or cell number) and I will attempt to resolve it as soon as possible. 

Most cells pull from the \images folder and do not require you to run any code. If for some reason a .gif or .png does not appear, report an issue with the page title and section and I will attempt to resolve the issue.
