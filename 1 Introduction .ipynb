    "# Frames of Reference and Relativity\n",
    "\n",
    "Something very important to cover before trying to discuss special relativity in the concept of frames of reference. Simply put, a frame of reference is the point of view from which events and objects are measured. In a bit more detail, it is the coordinate system in which objects and events are situated in order for us to talk about things like position and motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you're on the surface of the Earth watching a plane fly overhead at some speed $\\vec v$ to the East. From your point of view (i.e. from your frame of reference) you are able to measure its speed and direction, and possibly even infer something about where it will be some time in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "![personframe](https://imgur.com/hY8RbM8.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "While all of the measurements you take are valid in your frame, it would be equally valid for someone looking down at you from the plane to say that you are traveling at some speed $\\vec v$ to the West. In other words, if we treat the plane's frame of reference as stationary, you and the ground beneath your feet can be said to have motion relative to the plane. \n",
    "\n",
    "![planeframe](https://imgur.com/idnwLv9.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this is not normally how we would speak about the motion of objects on the ground relative to a flying object, so this may initially seem strange. However, the physics would still check out so long as we stay consistent with our frame of reference. [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "This fact is an important part of all physics. What this tells us is that we are free to choose whichever coordinate system best helps us to solve a problem. [1]\n"

    "\n",
    "Imagine you are standing on the ground, watching a train car where I am a passenger go by at some velocity $\\vec V$ in your frame of reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "![traingroundframe](https://imgur.com/ohSnLmI.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I am standing still on the train, you could say that I am also traveling at velocity $\\vec V$. This is because the horizontal motion of any object on the train, as observed in your reference frame, will have motion relative to the velocity of the train itself (i.e. to velocity $\\vec V$).  So if an object on the train is stationary, then it will have a velocity equal to $\\vec V$ in your frame; if it is traveling at some velocity $\\vec u$ in the direction of the train's horizontal motion, then it will have a velocity equal to $\\vec V + \\vec u$; and if it is moving in the opposite direction of the train's horizontal motion at some velocity $\\vec u$, then it will have a velocity equal to $\\vec V - \\vec u$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine that I drop a ball as I pass by you. Where will the ball end up as it falls? \n",
    "\n",
    "![traingroundframewball](https://imgur.com/wearcpS.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "In your frame, both the ball and I are traveling along the tracks with a constant velocity $\\vec V$ to the right. At the moment of release, the ball gains some downwards velocity due to gravitational acceleration. When we combine these two velocities as a vector sum, we get half of a parabolic arc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![pathofball](https://imgur.com/PYT102x.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From this we can see that, while the ball has a horizontal component to its motion in your frame, since this component is the same as the train’s, it will land on the floor directly beneath my hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also see this by switching frames from yours to mine. In my frame, the ball still drops to the ground, but you (as well as the track below me) are moving left at $\\vec V$. \n",
    "\n",
    "![trainframewball](https://imgur.com/YWI4eQr.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see here that there is no horizontal motion of the ball, so it naturally hits the floor below. The horizontal displacement you observed in your frame is explained by the motion of the tracks below. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in switching frames, we made a fairly large but important assumption. We took for granted that the laws of physics would not change (i.e. that the laws of physics are invariant). From the example above this seems to be true, but why? \n",
    "\n",
    "Since everything we’ve dealt with so far has been classical, let’s look at Newton’s laws. Since Newton’s laws describe how objects act in terms of velocities and accelerations, let’s look at an approximation of the ball’s velocity where we treat its downward motion as constant. In your frame (i.e. the ground frame), this velocity will be $\\vec u$ and in my frame (i.e. the train's frame), it will be $\\vec u'$. Since the train moves with a constant velocity $\\vec V$ relative to the ground, the velocity of the ball in you frame can be described as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec u = \\vec u' + \\vec V .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's 1st law tells us that an object will travel at a constant velocity unless acted upon by some external force. Granting that this already holds in your frame, so long as the ball is free from outside forces its velocity will be constant. So, when we solve for the velocity of the ball in my frame, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec u' = \\vec u - \\vec V $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "we see that it is the difference of two constant values. From there, it follows that $\\vec u'$ will also be constant and Newton's 1st holds for my frame. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Newton's second law ($ \\vec F = m \\vec a$), we need to show that $\\vec F'$, $m'$, and $\\vec a'$ (that is the force, mass, and acceleration in my frame) are equal to the $\\vec F$, $m$, and $\\vec a$ measured in your frame. \n",
    "\n",
    "In classical physics, mass will not change between frames of reference, so we can assume that this will be the case here. For acceleration, we derive it from the respective velocities of the two frames. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec a = \\frac{d\\vec u}{dt}  \\hspace{1.5cm}  \\vec a' = \\frac{d\\vec u'}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the acceleration in my frame and expanding it, we get \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec a' = \\frac{d(\\vec u - \\vec V)}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec a' = \\frac{d\\vec u}{dt} - \\frac{d\\vec V}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we already know that $\\vec V$ is constant, its derivative will be zero. That leaves us with \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec a' = \\frac{d\\vec u}{dt} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which we know from above is equal to $\\vec a$. Therefore, the two accelerations are equal. \n",
    "\n",
    "From here, it's easy to establish that $\\vec F' = \\vec F$. Since we know that classical mechanics requires $m' = m$ by definition and we have just shown that $\\vec a' = \\vec a$, we know that $m'\\vec a' = m\\vec a$ which is equal to $\\vec F' = \\vec F$. \n",
    "\n",
    "From here, it follows that Newton's 3rd law should also hold. As the 3rd law states: any action will result in an equal and opposite reaction. If we know that any force in one frame will be equal in the other, then it follows that the reaction forces will be as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that the invariance of Newton's laws will not be true if either frame is accelerating. This is easy to see, as any acceleration requires a force acting upon the frame, which would violate our proof of the first two laws. This is to say that the above will only apply to non-accelerated, or *inertial frames of reference*. This will be a useful concept to keep in mind as we move on. [1]"

    "# Speed of Light and the Postulates of Special Relativity\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on, it is worth discussing one more idea that is central to the theory of special relativity: the speed of light. The idea that light has a finite speed goes back to the 17th century when astronomers noticed variance in the time between eclipses of Jupiter's moons. Observing that the time interval between eclipses was shorter when Earth was close to Jupiter and longer when Earth was further away, they concluded that this must be because light had to travel a greater distance, and thus took longer to reach us, thus must have a finite speed. [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "In the nineteenth century, the physicist James Clerk Maxwell developed early forms of what would eventually be called Maxwell’s equations to propose that light was an electromagnetic wave. Importantly, Maxwell’s equations can be combined to show that electromagnetic waves propagate in a vacuum (i.e. without a medium) at a constant speed. [2] We can find this easily enough by showing that Maxwell’s equations in a vacuum become a version of the wave equation. I've left a derivation at the bottom of the page for anyone that would like to look over it, but it isn’t necessary to go over.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s remarkable about Maxwell’s equation’s prediction of a medium independent, constant speed of light is that, if Maxwell’s equations are like Newton’s laws and are invariant laws of physics, this must be true in all frames of reference. [1] [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the invariance of Maxwell’s equations, once again imagine that you are standing on the ground watching a plane fly overhead in some frame $S$. Remember that the plane is moving East at some velocity $\\vec v$. This time, we'll refer to the plane's frame of reference as $S'$. Now also imagine that the plane has a light bulb on its nose that emits a flash of light, represented by the yellow arrow. \n",
    "\n",
    "![planewlight](https://imgur.com/wxtf6Eh.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the bulb is on the plane, the light it emits with each flash travels away from it at speed $c$ in frame $S'$. Additionally, since we are assuming that Maxwell’s laws are invariant in all frames, the light must also be measured as traveling at speed $c$ in frame $S$. \n",
    "However this proves to be problematic, since if we try to use classical velocity addition like we did in the case of the ball on the train, we get that the light traveling in the same direction as the plane is have to be moving at some speed $\\vec v + c$ (the speed of the plane plus the speed of light in $S'$). Likewise, any light that is travelling in the opposite direction as the plane would be travelling at some speed $\\vec v - c$. In other words, according to the laws of classical physics, the speed of light should be frame dependent.   \n",
    "So, we have a dilemma to consider: either Newton's laws are true and Maxwell's equation do not hold in every frame of reference, or classical physics is wrong and the speed of light travels at a constant speed independent of any frame of reference. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many people took this as a sign that Maxwell’s laws were not entirely correct. It was Albert Einstein who considered the possibility that classical physics was in fact wrong, which in large part led to the development of the principles of special relativity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two ideas that we’ve discussed in this section make up the two postulates of special relativity:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.) The laws of physics hold in all frames of reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.) The speed of light is constant and independent of its source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving on, we will see how these two postulates function together to show some of its features. \n"
